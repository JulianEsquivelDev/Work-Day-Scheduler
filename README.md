# work-day-scheduler
Users have access to multiple time slots throughout a work day to save any tasks they want. Users can place any text in the desired timeslot and use the save icon to the right to save the new input. Once saved the input will stay in the slot even when the page is reloaded. The slots are connected to moment.js so they can detect the time of day. Depending on the time of the day the slots change colors to help the user see what tasks are still due or have passed. Users can benefit from this application to keep them on task throuhout the work day.
